**Hi Erfan**

5/21/24 4:44 PM

The only way Extraordinary Care could see his Medicaid plan would be at home if he is able to be seen at a hospital based infusion center closer to home?

We will hold off on this one for now—let me know if you're not able to find a provider who can see him in the infusion suite and we will re-open the referral.

- Discharge home with oral decadron 180mg (equivalent to 1000mg IVMP) x 1 to round out 5 days of high dose steroid treatment for active demyelinating lesion (family wishes to be discharged today instead of Saturday)
- He will then start oral prednisone taper: Instructions provided +PPI
- First dose of Rituximab or biosimilar scheduled for May 22 at 9am; second dose of first course of Rituximab within 2 weeks after, we are working with local infusion facility in Knoxville to get this set up for her moving forward to minimize travel
- He will follow up with ophthalmologist in Knoxville
- School note for this week and next week
- PT/OT locally
- Continue vitamin D
- I will see her tentatively 3 months after completion of 1st course of Rituximab - with same day MRI (she does not need sedation)- looking at early or mid September. Will update family once we have that arranged

**Synopsis:**

Shakh Abdulla is a 23 year old male who established care with VCH neurology; with MRI brain and spine demonstrating multiple lesions consistent with atypical pediatric MS.

**Hospital Course:**

Shakh Abdulla is a 23 year old male with history of optic neuritis and abnormal MRI brain concerning for MS who presented for admission following clinic visit and neuroimaging today. History from primary neurologist, clinic visit and patient and father at bedside. Patient referred to Dr. Gu by Dr. Fazal in East Bay. Confirms predominant symptoms since April of numbness in his right hand and urinary hesitancy/urgency. Additionally reporting right eye pain since time of clinic visit this morning. MRI brain and spine obtained following clinic visit and multiple lesions noted on brain and spine suggestive of pediatric MS. Presents for admission for IVMP.

**Per clinic visit earlier today with Dr. Gu and confirmed with family at bedside:**

Shakh is a 23 years old male, previously healthy who has been referred to neuroimmunology clinic for diagnosis of optic neuritis and abnormal brain MRI concerning for MS. He is referred by Dr Fazal-pediatric neurology in East Bay.

He is here with dad; patient himself is an excellent historian and provided the following information- I do not have CSF results nor clinic note- I do have MRI report from Jan 21 2024 (no actual images)- with father and his permission, I reached out to Dr Shane- Dr Fazal's colleague on service who can help assist with quick access to Shakh's chart.

Today, Shakh tells me that around early Oct 2023- he started to notice in right eye "neon bright color" fuzzy vision, and eye pain with movement and perhaps right side of his face in discomfort triggered by physical activities. Symptoms improved once he rested. By end of Oct 2023, he brought this up to parents and was brought to local eye doctor and recalled being told that "right eye being inflamed" and he recalled visual field deficits appreciated during exam.

He was referred to UT ophthalmology Dr Derrek in Jan this year, per report negative MOG and AQP4 [While waiting on this appt, he thought some improvement but not back to baseline entirely - "not completely normal"].

When he saw UT ophthalmology clinic, recommended brain and orbit and noted WM changes and MS was mentioned. He was treated with 5 days of IVMP and referred to see Dr Kosentka ped neurology.

MRI report from Jan 21 2024- "Diffuse T2 hyperintensity and decreased volume throughout the right optic nerve is similar to prior examination however associated abnormal enhancement seen on prior study has resolved, presumably secondary to interveal treatment.

Left optic nerve is subtle but diffusely small in caliber without significant change from last exam. Several intracranial WM lesions, stable from last"

He saw Dr Fazal in Feb 2024-who obtained LP and had markers of MS and referred to MS clinic today. Below are information provided by Dr Shane. Per note recommended referral to our MS center for further evaluation and treatment.

CSF ?WBC, 837 rbc, IgG Index 0.87 (elevated), +OCB

Prior to appt today May 14- he noted that in April of this year, started to have involvement of LEFT eye again similar with "neon colors appearance", some eye discomfort; it happened several times during the day for a few days and has since resolved

Since April he has had intermittent numbness in his right hand (dominant hand)+ along with muscle twitch in his hands and shoulder like tics

He has noticed a change with urinary hesitancy- taking a long time to empty his bladder and in addition urinary urgency

He has not noticed weakness but noted intermittent drifting to right side, bumping in to things

He does note that at times when he laughs, bends his neck, does note electrical sensation

Academically doing very well, no difficulty

Sleeps well

Family history: parents and brothers are healthy

**Floor course (05/14 -**

Patient was admitted to the wards in a stable condition.

Patient was initiated on high dose steroids for 5 days and tolerated well. MRI consistent with lesions in the brain and spinal cord consistent with atypical MS. ANA was positive as well as SSB so rheumatology was consulted but felt she did not have evidence of another systemic autoimmune disease. PT/OT evaluated his and he will follow outpatient. He was dc with Decadron and then steroid taper with Pepcid prophylaxis. He was arranged to have outpatient rituximab and Dr. Gu will follow his in clinic.
